# :space_invader: Coins App clone

## "bussiness assumptions" progress
- React Native and TypeScript :heavy_check_mark:
- Jest Tests :wavy_dash: 1/3
- SVG images :heavy_check_mark:
- List for 1000+ rows, and works smoother than Coins app (I swear! Just try by yourself) :heavy_check_mark:
- Price sorting :heavy_check_mark: (but is ugly)

## raport
- Toggl summary is in /task-raport directory
- App preview: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ijiws4xvnbNkmv0GJMMd5wbbkbvEXeuY/view?usp=sharing

## summary
- 7h 40min working time
- I have used Redux Saga for bussiness logic (separated "thread" helps with smooth list)
- I have no finished Views from "clean code side", and is kinda dirty there
- I have no use coinpaprika client, because looks poor (last commit 7 months ago)
- I not used to do tests so ofter, so I gave up with TDD and stuff like that. I've put writing test task at the end (I did not make it in time)
